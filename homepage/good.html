    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a student at the University of Alberta studying Computer Science.
      Currently, in my fourth year, I am looking forward to graduating in
      December 2023. I have many hobbies and interests, including playing sports
      such as squash. Volunteering at my local animal shelter has been very
      rewarding and enjoyable since I have a deep love for animals, especially
      cats.

    <h2>My history</h2>
    <p>
      Born and raised in the Democratic Republic of Congo, I moved to India for
      high school as my parents wanted me to study the IB program. After
      completing high school, I moved to Canada in 2019 to study at the
      University of Alberta. After starting as a Biology major and seeing that I
      did not see myself enjoying the end goal, I took some electives to see
      what I liked. One of these electives was CMPUT 174, which began my journey
      into the world of Computer Science. I enjoyed the course and decided to
      switch my major to Computer Science. I have enjoyed the remainder of my
      time at the University, learning more about this very interesting field. I
      have worked at a fast food chain and did enjoy my work there, but recently
      stopped it due to school and personal time commitments. 174
