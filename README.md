# Guttenberg files.

For all three html documents, I went to Project Guttenberg, clicked the HTML5 (not the submitted one) and then clicked on view source. I copied all the html into these documents and went about editing them so that I could style them. Then, I deleted the style tags in the head; I attempted to delete the in-line ones, but the files were too big to change all the in-line css. So, I deleted the style tags, renamed the images, added the link to the css file and then added the css file to css folder. I then added the styles I felt that fit the old feel we were told to aim for. Also, for stylistic preference, I removed the headings and titles from the top of the pages. I also added a link to the original pages.
